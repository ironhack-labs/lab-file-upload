## Introduction

[Tumblr](tumblr.com) is an ultra popular microblogging website.

**A microblog is:**

> A social media site to which a user makes short, frequent posts.

This is easier shown than described, so check out [this tumblr](http://bestdogmemes.tumblr.com/) filled with funny dog memes.

### Iteration 1 | User Profile Pictures

In the starter code, we've already provided a User model and the authentication logic. Unfortunately, the user doesn't have a profile picture.

Fix the User Registration so that it allows the user to upload a file as their profile image.

### Iteration 2 | Posts

In this iteration, create the bread and butter of Tumblr, the Post.

A post should have the following attributes:

- `content` - Text belonging to the post
- `creatorId` - ObjectId of the post's creator
- `picPath` - Where the picture is stored
- `picName` - The picture's name

For this iteration you must create the **model**, along with the **new**, **create**, **show** and **index** routes. This should include file uploading.

A user should be logged in to create a post, but *not* to view.

The **index** will be the home page, and simply display all of the posts on the website.

### Iteration 3 | Comments

Posts have comments attached to them. Create the Comment model as a subdocument of the Post.

A comment *can* have images attached to it, but not all do.

The model should have the following attributes:

- `content`
- `authorId`
- `imagePath`
- `imageName`

You should create routes to create new comments. Comments should be displayed on the Post *show* page.

### Iteration 4 | Deploy!

The last step in IronTumblr should be to deploy to Heroku. Don't forget to deploy your database on mongolab.

Your site should be live and functioning with a working URL.
